A window resizer plugin using jquery - the script is well documented, but I will add more documentation soon!

My to do list:
1. prevent flickering caused by resizing to the maximum screen size before adjusting to the new screen resolution
2. have an option to use full screen size
3. if user defines an array of screen sizes the overwrite the default sizes, it is currently mergin them using the jQuery extend() method, but I can easily change that
