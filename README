jQuery Window Resizer plugin
v0.1 - basic functionality built
v0.2 - added min/max key command - so that it can be used on very low resolutions when the  control panel isn't fully displayed

Settings:
sizes		:	JSON data - an array of value pairs representing screen resolutions
index		:	number - keps track of currently selected resolution, can be set, but really just a data holder
loopDelay	:	number - on slideshow mode the period between display resolutions
bodyOverflow	:	boolean - sets body to display scrollbars or not
controlBtns	:	boolean - displays the list of screen sizes as buttons in control panel
resizeInput	:	boolean - displays the form to allow manual entering of screen sizes
playBox		:	boolean - allows control panel for the 'slideshow' feature
press "m"	: 	not an option - pressing the "m" key will toggle the controls to/from minimised view
left arrow	:	not an option - activate the previous window size in the list
right arrow	:	not an option - activate the next window size in the list

My to do list:
1. prevent flickering caused by resizing to the maximum screen size before adjusting to the new screen resolution
2. have an option to use full screen size
3. if user defines an array of screen sizes the overwrite the default sizes, it is currently mergin them using the jQuery extend() method, but I can easily change that
